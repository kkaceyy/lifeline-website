	<p>Ever since I was diagnosed with thalassemia, I was overall cautious of my daily ventures. Unlike most teens enjoy the sunlight and go to beaches, I am limited to even go to the most basic things humans can do. Minutes into exposure in the sun, petechiae appears. I also experienced having transfusions of blood beginning to college due to my enlarged spleen working too hard because my body is not creating enough hemoglobin. I am also pale and mild yellow skin. After I was diagnosed, it explains everything in high school where I would faint in minimal extracurricular activities in my school. Overtime, even though my actions are limited due to the disease I have, I learned to enjoy life normally. I also applied the instructions the doctors gave and it will never hinder me from pursuing and chasing my dreams, to become a registered nurse someday.</p
